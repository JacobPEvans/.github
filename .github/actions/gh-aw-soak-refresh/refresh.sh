# Refresh gh-aw action SHA pins with a 24h supply-chain soak.
#
# 1. Snapshot HEAD's lock file (the "before" state).
# 2. Force-refresh all pins to current upstream SHAs.
# 3. For each entry whose SHA changed AND the new SHA's commit is <24h
#    old, rewind that entry's SHA to its predecessor in the lock file.
#    The `version` field is left unchanged; the lock file stays consistent.
# 4. Re-emit .lock.yml files via a no-flag `gh aw compile`.
#
# First-time pins (no predecessor in HEAD's lock file) skip the rewind
# and adopt the fresh SHA -- recurring refreshes never encounter this.
