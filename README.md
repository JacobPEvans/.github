# .github

Default community health files, issue templates, and shared configurations for all JacobPEvans repositories.

## About This Repository

This is GitHub's special **`.github` repository**, which provides organization-wide default files for all public repositories.
Files stored here are automatically inherited by any repository that doesn't have its own version.

### How Inheritance Works

**Automatic Inheritance**: When someone views a community health file in a repository that doesn't have one, GitHub displays the version from this `.github` repository.
This happens in real-time.
No syncing is required.

**Search Order**: GitHub looks for files in this order within both the target repository and this `.github` repository:

1. The `.github/` folder
2. The repository root
3. The `docs/` folder

**One-Way Flow**: Files in this repository serve as fallbacks. Changes here don't overwrite or sync to repositories that already have their own versions.

**Override Behavior**: Any repository can override these defaults by creating its own version of a file.
For issue templates specifically, if a repository has ANY files in its own `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder, NONE of the defaults from this repository will be used.

**Public Requirement**: This repository **must be public** for inheritance to work organization-wide.
Private `.github` repositories only work for private repositories in the same organization.

#### `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

Standardized [issue forms][issue-forms-docs] that enforce the label taxonomy and collect structured information:

| Template              | Description                               | Auto-Label     | File                  |

| **Template Config**   | Disables blank issues, configures chooser | -              | `config.yml`          |

**All templates require**:

- Priority selection (`priority:critical/high/medium/low`)
- Size estimation (`size:xs/s/m/l/xl`)

#### `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`

Standardized [pull request templates][pr-templates-docs] that enforce conventional commits and collect structured information:

| Template              | Use Case                          | Type Label      | File                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Default/General**   | Chores, CI, tests, other changes  | Multiple        | `pull_request_template.md`   |
| **Bug Fix**           | Bug fixes with root cause         | `type:bug`      | `bug.md`                     |
| **Feature**           | New features with design docs     | `type:feature`  | `feature.md`                 |
| **Breaking Change**   | Breaking changes with migration   | `type:breaking` | `breaking.md`                |
| **Documentation**     | Docs improvements                 | `type:docs`     | `docs.md`                    |
| **Refactoring**       | Code refactoring with impact      | `type:refactor` | `refactor.md`                |
| **Performance**       | Performance improvements          | `type:perf`     | `performance.md`             |

**All templates require**:

- Conventional commit format in PR title (`type(scope): description`)
- Related issue linking
- Type, priority, and size labels
- GPG-signed commits

**Selecting a template**:

- Default template loads automatically
- Use query parameter for specific template: `?template=bug.md`
- Templates align with [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] specification

#### `.github/workflows/`

[GitHub Actions workflows][workflows-docs] that automate label management:

| Workflow                 | Purpose                              | Trigger                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `auto-label-issues.yml`  | Apply priority/size from issue forms | Issue creation            |
| `label-sync.yml`         | Deploy `labels.yml` to all repos     | Push to main, manual      |

**Auto-label**: When an issue is created from a template, the workflow extracts
the user's dropdown selections (priority and size) and applies labels.

**Label sync**: When `labels.yml` is updated and pushed to main, deploys the
canonical labels to all repositories.
Can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

[workflows-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows

## Label System

All repositories use a consistent labeling taxonomy for issue classification and workflow management.

**See [LABELS.md](docs/LABELS.md) for complete documentation.**

### Quick Reference

- **Type labels** (`type:*`): bug, feature, breaking, docs, chore, ci, test, refactor, perf, security
- **Priority labels** (`priority:*`): critical, high, medium, low
- **Size labels** (`size:*`): xs, s, m, l, xl
- **AI workflow labels** (`ai:*`): created, ready, reviewed, skip-review
- **Workflow labels**: ready-for-dev, good-first-issue
- **Triage labels**: duplicate, invalid, wontfix, question

## Using These Files in Your Repositories

### Option 1: Inherit (Recommended)

Simply don't create your own versions of community health files. GitHub will automatically display files from this `.github` repository as fallbacks.

**How to check**: Visit `https://github.com/JacobPEvans/YOUR_REPO/community` to see which files are inherited vs. defined in your repository.

**Pros**: Zero maintenance. Updates to this repository automatically apply to all repos without their own files.

**Cons**: Can't customize per-repository without losing inheritance completely.

### Option 2: Override

Create your own version of a file in your repository to override the default.

**Examples**:

- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` to your repo root or `docs/` folder to replace the inherited version
- Add any file to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` to disable ALL template inheritance

**Pros**: Full customization for specific repository needs.

**Cons**: Loses automatic updates from this `.github` repository.

### Option 3: Sync Labels

Labels are **not inherited** automatically.
The [label-sync workflow](.github/workflows/label-sync.yml) deploys labels
from [`.github/labels.yml`](.github/labels.yml) to all repositories
whenever the file is updated on `main`.

To trigger a manual sync:

```bash
gh workflow run label-sync.yml -R JacobPEvans/.github
```

> **Note**: Avoid using `gh label clone` for cross-repo syncing.
> It copies from a repo's current GitHub label state, not from
> `labels.yml`, which can propagate drift.
